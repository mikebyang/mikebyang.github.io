            <p class = "textblock-paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">
                Undergraduate courses for my majors are currently being taken at Rutgers University - New Brunswick.
                I am currently the acting co-webmaster for the Mechanical Engineering Student Association (MESA) website and the current webmaster for the Rutgers Civic Education website.
                I have worked as a research assistant for three years in two different labs while at Rutgers.
                The first two years of research was focused on paper applications in mechanical engineering and the possible use of paper in robotics.
                This past year's research was focused on mapping using a lidar in conjunction with the Lidar Odometry and Mapping (LOAM) algorithm.
                Currently, I am working with other mechanical engineers to create a drone with mid-air docking capabilities.
